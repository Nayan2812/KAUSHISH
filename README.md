In todayâ€™s evolving digital landscape, access to job and internship
opportunities plays a crucial role in shaping the careers of students and
graduates. However, despite the growing demand for technical skills, many
students face significant challenges in securing relevant work experience.
Students and graduates from technical education often face difficulties finding
suitable jobs and internships. A gap between job seekers and employers limits
opportunities for students to gain practical experience. The lack of a single
platform for both government and private internships further complicates the
process. Privacy concerns, slow responses from recruiters, and little feedback
create additional obstacles. Our project aims to build an interactive platform to
address these challenges by connecting students with employers. It will
feature job matching, internship listings, sample projects, and mentorship
programs. Users will receive feedback, track progress, and develop skills
through real-world projects.
